I talk about the initial side effects I experienced, such as nausea and dizziness, and how they subsided after a few weeks. I also share how my mood and overall mental health have improved since starting the medication, including being able to enjoy activities that I previously found difficult to find pleasure in.

Overall, my journey on antidepressants has been a positive one, and I hope that sharing my experience can provide insight and support for others who may be considering medication as part of their mental health treatment plan.

Dr. Laura Erickson-Schroth, the Chief Medical Officer at The Jed Foundation, outlines different options for treating depression, including group or individual therapy, and emphasizes how important it is to keep an open mind when exploring different types of treatments. Other strategies for managing depression include exercising regularly, engaging in group therapy, and reaching out to your community.

Dr. Erickson-Schroth also shares insight on how isolation can worsen depression. It's important to stay in with contact friends and family, engage in support activities, and reach out to your primary care provider, who can look into any medical issues you might be experiencing.

Now though, I've made a video all about it! 

This is a video I've been thinking about making for many years - I guess it finally felt like the right time. Despite how it may look, this is not a confessional, not a cry for help or anything like that, I am well removed from the events I talk about. 
Instead, I have made this video with the aim to help others that might in a similar place to where I once was, or know someone that is. I also wanted to share what it's like to be on these powerful drugs, because I don't think doctors always prepare people very well for what's going to happen to them.

These were the anti-depressants I was prescribed:
Fluoxetine, brand name Prozac
Paroxetine, brand names Paxil and Seroxat 
Venlafaxine, brand name Effexor
Sertraline, brand name Zoloft

If you're considering starting SSRIs or are already on them, it's important to understand how SSRIs affect your body. We‚Äôll dive into common SSRI side effects, including weight gain, emotional changes, sexual side effects, and how long-term SSRI use can impact your health.

Many people experience SSRI withdrawal symptoms when discontinuing the medication, so we‚Äôll discuss how to manage SSRI withdrawal safely. If you're dealing with anxiety or depression, SSRIs can be an effective treatment, but it's crucial to weigh the pros and cons of antidepressant use. We'll also cover how antidepressants work, the risks associated with taking SSRIs, and how to address side effects like weight changes, emotional blunting, and other physical reactions.

If you've ever wondered how SSRIs interact with your mental health and body, this video is for you. We‚Äôll also talk about managing SSRI side effects and how to discuss potential risks with your doctor. Understanding these antidepressant side effects can help you make informed decisions about your mental health treatment and manage the impact of SSRI medications on your daily life.

Stay tuned to learn more about the side effects of SSRI medications and how to approach your depression treatment plan with confidence. Whether you're new to antidepressants or have been taking them for a while, this guide will provide valuable insights.

Many different types of drug classes can cause akathisia including prescription drugs commonly marketed for depression--selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, (SSRIs). Other types of drugs that can cause akathisia include, but are not limited to, drugs prescribed for high blood pressure, acne, asthma, malaria, and infections (antibiotics). 

Please see and share this animated educational video that addresses:
What is akathisia? 
What causes akathisia?
What can you do if you or a loved one experiences this life-threatening disorder?

Nobody is immune to akathisia. But by increasing awareness of akathisia, sufferers can get help before it's too late. Together, we can save lives.

About MISSD

(The Medication-Induced Suicide Prevention and Education Foundation in Memory of Stewart Dolin) is a unique non-profit organization dedicated to honoring the memory of Stewart and other victims of akathisia by raising awareness and educating the public about the dangers of akathisia. MISSD aims to ensure that people suffering from akathisia's symptoms are accurately diagnosed so that needless deaths are prevented. A website, the creation of educational materials, and support of conferences such as Selling Sickness, will help to raise awareness and knowledge of akathisia and medication-induced suicides. Again, we feel it's important to note that we are not anti-drug, and recognize that prescription drugs can be positive and life-saving for many individuals. We are for truth in disclosure, honesty in reporting, and legitimate drug trials.

The term ""anti-depressants"" is really a misnomer, and may cause individuals to believe that their only option for treating anxiety disorders with medication, are to use medications with abuse potential (which is NOT TRUE). SSRI's and SNRI's can be some of the most-effective forms of treatment for anxiety disorders, for certain individuals. 

Dr. Pagnani is the founder and medical director of Rittenhouse Psychiatric Associates, an Instructor at The Johns Hopkins Hospital for the Department of Psychiatry, he supervises psychiatric residents at Jefferson Hospital, he serves on the Young Professional Board of Uplift, the Center for Grieving Children and he maintains a private practice of Psychiatry in Philadelphia where he sees patients for one-time psychiatric evaluations and second opinions. He is a licensed physician and surgeon in NJ, PA, NY, MD, DE, FL and CA and can provide consultations to individuals via HIPAA compliant Telehealth visits living in these locations.

Rittenhouse Psychiatric Associates is a private practice of psychiatry consisting of about 25 psychiatrists, psychiatric nurse practitioners and psychotherapists with physical locations in Philadelphia and Paoli, PA and serving all of PA, NJ, NY and FL virtually via HIPAA compliant tele-psychiatry. Individuals seeking not only evaluations but long-term psychiatric care, can contact Rittenhouse Psychiatric Associates directly.

These videos aim to increase awareness and discussion of mental health topics and to encourage struggling individuals to schedule an appointment directly with a mental health provider. Mental health needs to be normalized, and simply speaking about mental health topics openly, is an important first step. 

Dr. Pagnani and Rittenhouse Psychiatric Associates are NOT advocating for or against the use of any mentioned psychiatric medications for any specific individual. Additionally, any side effects mentioned are not a complete list of potential side effects or contraindications to taking any mentioned medications, and all risks and benefits of a medication should be discussed with an individual‚Äôs provider at an appointment, before starting, stopping or making changes to a medication regimen.

Therapy helps you to develop mechanisms to support your own mental health, which in turn may improve the rest of your life.

Therapy can also help someone identify such thoughts as inaccurate and develop behaviors based on a more positive, realistic life outlook.

A mental health professional may provide a fresh perspective on an issue. They can give people a better understanding of their own emotions.

Clinical therapist, widower, and co-creator of ‚ÄúGiving Sunshine‚Äù Jason Clawson joined the boys on the podcast last Wednesday to share how his family took a horrible tragedy and turned it into something good.

Public Health Scotland figures show that medication was prescribed to 20,825 children aged up to 19 in 2019-20.

That is an increase of more than 80% in less than a decade (11,507 in 2010-11).

However, in that time it has almost trebled among ten to 14-year-olds (541 to 1501).

And it has almost doubled among those aged 15 to 19 (10,877 to 19,190).

Dr Jane Morris, vice-chair of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in Scotland, said: ‚ÄúWe would have to have a lot more careful research done to see whether the apparent association is causative.

‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs something that all of us in Scotland are calling for at the moment, which is an improvement not only in the amount of research that is undertaken with young people, but also I think people are waking up to the need for good public health figures.‚Äù",STV News,2007-05-16T09:32:28Z,62800,11343,1,1,-1,1,1,"brain zaps, nausea, dizziness",Depression,-1,Prozac,1,", 20mg.",-1,,1,72,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Dr. Laura Erickson-Schroth, the Chief Medical Officer at The Jed Foundation, outlines different options for treating depression, including group or individual therapy, and emphasizes how important it is to keep an open mind when exploring different types of treatments. Other strategies for managing depression include exercising regularly, engaging in group therapy, and reaching out to your community.

Dr. Erickson-Schroth also shares insight on how isolation can worsen depression. It's important to stay in with contact friends and family, engage in support activities, and reach out to your primary care provider, who can look into any medical issues you might be experiencing.

Today on The Ranveer Show, we welcome Dr. Samir Parikh. He is a consultant psychiatrist and the Director of the Department of Mental Health and Behavioral Sciences, Fortis Healthcare, with 26 years of expertise. In this podcast, we broke down the topic of mental health at a deeper level.

In this episode, we talked about depression, anxiety, why people feel depressed, and the effect of bullying on a person‚Äôs mental health, when you should visit a doctor, why people self-diagnose themselves, and much more. We also discuss ADHD and how it can affect daily life, the impact of bullying on mental health, particularly in the digital age, and the importance of seeking professional help for various mental health conditions.

This was a mental health special episode that, in my opinion, everyone should watch to understand when they should see a doctor and what is the reason behind their prolonged sadness. I hope you will enjoy this conversation and let us know your thoughts in the comments.

There are a lot of misconceptions about antidepressants. In this video Lyle will dispel some of the myths and tell you the real pros and cons of antidepressants. Just in general antidepressants are a controversial topic. Some people swear by them, while others think they're nothing more than a band-aid for the real problem. At Alternative to Meds Center, we utilize effective antidepressant alternative treatments that can resolve the problems associated with remaining on medication for a lifetime. Whether users struggle with adverse effects, the ineffectiveness of the medication, or simply want to treat their mental health naturally, antidepressant alternatives can provide answers that were overlooked.


Handling Root Causes for Symptoms
There can be many different factors that are negatively impacting a person. For instance, perhaps the individual is overwhelmed by a life that is unfulfilling and they need a better or different environment to make changes. Perhaps toxic relationships, social stress, and workplace tension, as examples, are causing untenable distress. Using a version of CBT known as Positive CBT, or another preferred form of talk therapy, these factors in life can be worked on as part of an overall plan. Perhaps one has gotten complacent and needs to overhaul their exercise, diet, and fitness regimens. Genetic factors have also been suggested in research published in the Journal of Affective Disorders. Certain genetic polymorphisms have become a newly studied area for potential treatments, though more research is needed in this area.  All of these factors can be addressed for positive improvements with a comprehensive roster of therapies and strategies designed to help these specific areas.

But we find by far that one of the main culprits in symptoms like depression, anxiety, and insomnia. mood swings and other complaints are that the body will test positive for an accumulation of toxic residues. These could be heavy metals from dentistry, medications, or other exposures in the home or from work, from cleaning products, pollution, food additives, and other sources.
The good news is that the body responds positively when these are eliminated through colonics, sauna, chelation, and other cleansing methods. How exciting to be able to rid oneself of toxic sludge and the symptoms that are relieved by doing so.

Antidepressants are not always the answer and there are often natural alternatives that offer similar practical effects. We are dedicated to providing safe and effective antidepressant alternative treatments to those in need and if you ever struggle with antidepressants or wish to explore more holistic treatment options please don‚Äôt hesitate to contact us for more information.

Are Your Symptoms Related to Toxic Impairment?
impairment caused by heavy metals. Additionally, accumulations of environmental toxins over time may take an enormous toll on both physical and mental well-being. This toxic burden places a strain on the body‚Äôs ability to metabolize and produce energy. This underlying factor can complicate antidepressant withdrawal. Heavy metals are linked to a number of commonly reported symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Accumulated heavy metals can be removed from the body gently and effectively using the protocols in our program.

Integrated Holistic Care to get off Antidepressants
Alternative to Meds Center determines the medical reasons why a person might be depressed, anxious, or unable to sleep. Our program uses lab testing, stabilizes the neurochemistry through the use of natural substances based on orthomolecular medicine, and employs detoxification for accumulated environmental neurotoxins. Using an array of these and other services, the center provides personalized antidepressant withdrawal help.

Alternative to Meds Center does much more than alleviate antidepressant withdrawal. We search for and correct the underlying causes of depression.
